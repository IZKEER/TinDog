## My process

i've started this one by doing the HTML, learning about Bootstrap grids and styling.
Using bootstrap feels soo much easier and fast to make a webpage, responsive.
So, who doesn't like dogs? and to love? This website template has been made thinking about our PETS love story. Your dog has a Soul mate, but maybe he hasn't found it yet.
